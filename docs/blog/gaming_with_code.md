Since I was a little boy I always liked to play games, from starting with vidoe games and board games.
The main reason I started getting interested in starting to become a programmer was also due to my love of video games.

While being a programmer one of the things that you do in general is to either keep up with your current programming language and changes that are added to it or learning new programming languages.
By default you always have your 'sample' apps that you try to create as first, in front-end world the 'to-do' list app is one that comes to mind.
For me this is boring after your 10th to-do list, hence why I look for different methods to improve and sharpen my programming 'knifes'.

On a day to day basis we all face certain challenges on our jobs, but for me mostly they are not the algorithmical challenges that make me think in different ways.

Luckily for me, there are many ways I can combine my love for gaming and my thirst for learning and keep challenging myself.
In this post I'll go over a few different ways that gaming and coding are combined these days.

## Different kind of 'coding'

- As an addition to your games
  - Think about macros in MMORPGs
  - Mods for games etc.
  - Managing a ripped of version of a paid game...

- Coding in games
  - Use code to complete actual game objectives

- Competition based coding
  - Coding algorithms to learn
  - Team based competitions solving problems
  - CTF's

## Coding in games

Code is central in these games

Most known to me is Hacknet or while true: learn()

## Competition based coding

Bulk of the 'learning' for me.
- Algorithmic
- New tools
- Challenging

### Codewars

- Useful as a learning tool for improving language knowledge
- Small challenges you can do daily/weekly
- More random compared to other platforms as Hackerrank etc.


### Hash code

- Team based algoritmic competition held around the world
- Difficult 'real life challenges to solve'

### CTF

- More towards red security testing
- Learn a lot about the systems we work with
- Very very challenging at the start

### Code golf

- Never use this at work
- Make the smallest code possible, character count

## Special shoutout

Advent of code
- Competition held every year around the world
- Every day a new challenge
- Big community with amazing results

## Question to you!

Do you use tools like gaming with code as a learning source?
